___

#### Stack
- **JS Framework**: [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- **CSS Framework**: [Bulma CSS](https://bulma.io/)


#### Get started
This application has been crafted with [Vue-CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/). I suggest you to read the [documentation](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/) if you have never used it before.

First of all, you have to clone the project and install npm dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sanfra1407/vue-cash-flow.git
cd vue-cash-flow
npm install
```


#### Development server
To serve a development environment, you have to run:
```bash
npm run serve
```
A local server will start at http://localhost:8080/


#### Build
If you want to compile the production version, you just need to run:
```bash
npm run build
```
A `dist/` directory will be created, in the application root, with all optimized assets.


#### Deploy 
To deploy your application, you can follow the [official Vue-CLI guide](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/deployment.html).
